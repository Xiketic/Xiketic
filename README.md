# Hi ðŸ‘‹
I'm @Xiketic, a crazy scientist with way too many ideas and an eye for design. Most of my experiments never see the light of day, but the experience gained is felt in every experiment after. 

## What?
I'm well versed in: Java, Kotlin, JavaScript, Typescript (Next, React and Vue), CSS and HTML. Occasionally I can be found in Ilustrator or Figma

## Who
Me? I love writing and telling stories, if you have a book or movie recommendation, hit me up.
